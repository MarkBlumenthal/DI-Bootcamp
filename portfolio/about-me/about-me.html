<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I was born in Johannesburg, South Africa. After High School I decided<br> to go and study Travel & Tourism.
  After the 3 year course, I decided<br> to Move to sunny Cape Town where I lived for almost 15 years. I took<br>
  up a job in Property Management where I was very happy for 8 years.<br> Living in Cape Town, allowed me to
  persue my side passion of fishing.<br> I love the outdoors and try to spend as much time in nature as possible.<br>
  After moving to Israel with my wife, I decided it was the perfect oppertunity<br> to start a new career in
  the High Tech industry. I find tremendous joy in<br> programming and building web applications & websites. 
  The idea that<br> I can be apart of building a website or app that thousands of people use<br> gives me alot of
  pride and joy.
