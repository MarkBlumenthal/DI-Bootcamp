        <h1>THOR ODINSON</h1>
        <p>
            "Thor is the "God of Thunder",a member of the race known<br> as the Asgardians, 
            a group of humanoid beings from the<br> pocket dimension of Asgard, the Realm Eternal.
            Thor is the<br> son of Odin, the All-Father and king of Asgard. He was<br> worshiped by the humans known as 
            Vikings and became part<br> of Norse Mythology. Armed with his enchanted Uru hammer<br> Mjolnir,
            which helps him to channel his godly energies, he<br> became the mightiest warrior in the Ten Realms. 
            When his<br> irresponsible and impetuous behavior became too much, Odin<br> sent him to Midgard
            (more commonly known as Earth) as a<br> disabled mortal medical student named Donald Blake,
            stripped<br> of his memory. After learning humility he regained his memory<br> as well as his godly powers.
            Thor went on to become a champion<br>for Midgard as well as one of the founding members of the Avengers,<br> 
            "Earth's Mightiest Heroes".
